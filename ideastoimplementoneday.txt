TODO: change map wins to be / account instead of localstorage, bc there are actually a really high # of players playing on multiple devices (school and home for example, or switching browsers)




make the menu screen have 3 (5) animations. Those being:

starfield
perlin noise
particles

all from nova, just copypaste.

fixed seed rng for speedruns (/setseed)

discord bot announcing wins

leaderboard

timer

networked mapmaker

culling

tp immersive option? Or make it a custom obstacle because "if everyone's super then no one is" -> obs arent cool if everyone has them 

interesting idea: you are in a square box and shapes come at you. You have to draw the shapes by pressing shift (speedmult = 2 on shift so it doesnt slow you down) to clear them before they reach you (they're all lava and go to the center of the box). Fixed cam.

grapple can be done by testing a sat.circle as big as the max radius and seeing what has the highest res.overlap (grapple pts have priority ofc)

button press animation (less alpha) when standing on powerup blocks (namely grap, death)

optimize death message to [type, isDead, ...id bytes for server]

optimize ctx.createRadialGradient and regenerate on init and if(dimensions.x !== o.timeTrapGradientDimensionsX) in cr

when decoupling rendering from simulation (interpolation) make sure to regenerate topLeft and dimensions or have a margin 

invisible maze but you have grapple with 0 force

make plat arrow move speed sync with terminal falling speed

network hub obstacles like pong and drawing

Advanced music extra file that overrides play, pause, etc. Loads the youtube api behind the scenes (https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api)
let player = new YT.Player('player', {
    height: '360',
    width: '640',
    videoId: 'VIDEO_ID', // Replace with your video ID
    events: {
        'onReady': (e) => {console.log('player is ready!');}
    }
});
and uses player.pauseVideo / player.playVideo or other stuff in the api

Cool animations:

posc energy drink should be toec. Either find the song or modify

ok so this is what i'll do in order:
- fix obstacles on non-60 fps âœ…
- fix some obstacle bugs in current maps
    - circleSlice âœ…
    - new movement sys bug âœ…
- finalize tutorial design
    - update to dynamic resolution if need be
- fix platformer
- "R to Respawn" on the tutorial
- fix grapple bugs (can't grapple to normal obs even if outside the range of grap points and they exist and intersecting normal obs)
    - fix stopForces cancelling grap force permanently even when you step off (maybe should just set xv and accels to 0)
- fix breakable bugs (after letting it regen and messing around a bit in tutorial)
// - accounts and logging in
//     - create account screen w/ flowr animation in, eX style
//     - star field animation (probably sep page or make it not load on a normal gp because three.js is expensive)
- get all maps in the game
- music system âœ… + get all the specific musics in for all the maps
- gameloop (spawn in the tutorial, end of tutorial you create an account, menu screen is never seen again)
- make accounts save progress, stats
    - format: {mapName: [total attempts, total wins, total solo wins, fastest win, total time spent]}
- powerups death timer, invincibility, dash, grapple and grapple point obstacle 
- sync map system. When you enter a map that another player is in, they send the state 
    - also when dt > 1000 refetch map
- fix all bugs with current maps
    - remove eval(str), make all maps just a series of shared.C() calls
    - grapple and deathtimer and other powerups should be removed when transitioning between maps (on client and server) and weird bug w/ deathTimer = 5000 when entering and exiting maps with deathtimer in hub
- get omni back up and running
- map editor w/ custom code (resizable bar like leetcode)
    - hook up with omni?
- level sharing system (planet in game where you can browse levels)
- new tutorial map w/ cone mapping
    - should be simple but also fun but also suprising like a yt intro
- trailer (should be working on continuously for like an hour a day)
- make server not load maps
- anticheat, load testing, security
    - also clean up code, idk if there will be any other examples but shared.resizeElements taking an array should b changed âœ…
    - players should simulate other players, get some bonus if they catch hackers (to incentivise)

// 3d system design. Had to design it now because im designing the tutorial and we shouldnt make 2 diff systems

Basically there will be a webgl canvas behind the normal canvas that can be activated/ deactivated when you step on an obstacle called changeDimensions. It has parameters enable2d and enable3d (separate booleans) so you can have both active at the same time. Obstacles stay in their respective dimension but there will be methods in future for converting. 3d obstacles are just like regular obstacles except they have a extra parameters like z and d (stands for depth, like w/h stand for width/height). Also, 3d obstacles have an extra extrusion shape type which defines how their 2d form will be projected to 3d. For now, the only extrusion type will be just a straight vertical line (e.g. circles becoming cylinders, rects becoming rectangular prisms) because that's the only one i need for now and we can always implement more later. Obstacles in 3d will be rendered by drawing an image of them on a 2d canvas (auxillary canvas, not the main one that could be occupied by 2d) and then getting the canvas image data of their dimensions.x,y. The images will be mapped onto the top and bottom faces of the 3d obs and i might manually define the middle or set it to the average pixel color or something. There will be another simulate/effect map for obstacles whose behavior can extend to 3d, e.g. like snapgrid will also have to snap z.

tutorial
1. Star field render fades in + the texts "Welcome, Traveler." followed by "Welcome to Evades X" appear. âœ…
2. Obstacle explanation with the animation i made.
    - "You are a circle, moving on an infinite grid."
    - [cam zooms out, obs come in] "Now, the whole game is made out of obstacles." 
    - "Obstacles can have a shape," 
        - "simulate," 
        - "and effect." 
    - [fade to real game, not animation] "Your objective is to dodge them to reach the goal [rainbow text] as fast as possible."
        - "Good luck, and don't die!"
3. Obstacle section w/ the 4 buttons.
    - After you finish, "Good job!" 
    - "Now, you're almost ready to be released into the wide world of Evades X."
    - "But before I let you in, I want to warn you."
    - "Evades X is a game where anything is possible."
    - "So the only thing you should expect..."
        - "is the unexpected." [shader morphs from normal to flag warp to oval to lens distort - winpad at the top and you have to reach it and then page refreshes and you get put in the hub]

New plan (17th-20th)
- sync map system ðŸ¥™
- win messages or some way to tell that players are 
- import poqt (funky version)
    - music!
    - finish polish!
    - tetris
- fix pohistory (down the list gets more optional)
    - z8 and z9 ðŸ¥™
    - e1 render like e1, e2 like e2, ex like ex ðŸ¥™
    - redo some of the eX levels
    - e1 -> eX text animation at the start?
- fix pospd
    - make the normal section consistent ðŸ¥™
    - make platformer use the old route, add coin below so that player knows to fall off to not hit their head between jumps ðŸ¥™
- fix tutorial (w/ dynamic res, no dt) ðŸ¥™
- anticheat, load testing, security
- make all maps C calls instead of generators
- remove all TEMP
- make winroom send back to hub (msg update) ðŸ¥™
- fix rotating text culling being broken - not bounding boxes cuz they're already regenerated ðŸ¥™
    - might be something with initialRotation in general?
    - fix bug cannot read undefined reading pos sometimes bricking the game (i think fetch req msgs out of order bug) ðŸ¥™?

if i have time make 

animation for poph that starts with e1 text and ends with eX, or zoom out and vinette fades in if i have time

- add animation
- finish the actual map
- add a checkpoint to zone 9... cuz u havent made zone 9 yet i can't . just search for the checkpoint effect type and u will find the place i made checkpoints lol
- add zone obs (not necessary) 


- add a credits section to the lobby idk put zerotix there or smth lmao would be funny as shit (dont actually idk)
- a way to see stats from portal instead of instant teleporting
- win msg shows if solo or not
- discord bot to link disc account to evades x account, allowing for completion roles being given (like, completing hardcore gives u the hardcore role)
- discord bot announces wins in the planet wins channel (otherwise hide it from view)

- discord server minor adjustments like bad language in rules, font should be inter or soulmaze, etc.




----
add emojis to discord server / finish setup stuff idk
discord bot setup
logo design
fading difficulties redesign (with animation isntead of just opacity)
make galaxy
finish up podd

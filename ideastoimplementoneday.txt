make the menu screen have 3 (5) animations. Those being:

starfield
perlin noise
particles

all from nova, just copypaste.

fixed seed rng for speedruns (/setseed)

discord bot announcing wins

leaderboard

timer

ok so this is what i'll do in order:
- fix obstacles on non-60 fps
- fix some obstacle bugs in current maps
    - circleSlice
- accounts and logging in
    - create account screen w/ flowr animation in, eX style
    - star field animation (probably sep page or make it not load on a normal gp because three.js is expensive)
- get all maps in the game
- music system + get all the specific musics in for all the maps
- gameloop (spawn in the tutorial, end of tutorial you create an account, menu screen is never seen again)
- make accounts save progress, stats
    - format: {mapName: [total attempts, total wins, total solo wins, fastest win, total time spent]}
- powerups death timer, invincibility, dash, grapple and grapple point obstacle 
- sync map system. When you enter a map that another player is in, they send the state 
- fix all bugs with current maps
- map editor w/ custom code (resizable bar like leetcode)
    - hook up with omni?
- level sharing system (planet in game where you can browse levels)
- new tutorial map w/ cone mapping
    - should be simple but also fun but also suprising like a yt intro
- trailer (should be working on continuously for like an hour a day)
- anticheat, load testing, security
    - players should simulate other players, get some bonus if they catch hackers (to incentivise)
